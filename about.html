           <p> <strong> Casa de Maná </strong> is a profit organization that helps the less fortunate in our municipio.</p>

           <p>The mission of the <strong> Casa de Maná </strong>  is to alleviate hunger and diminish the plights of poverty for those who enter our doors. Our primary objectives include teaching financial accountability, facilitating an elevation in personal morals and values, and helping each patron achieve their full potential.</p>

           <p>We believe in the inherent worth of people. In order to succeed, charity and compassion from the community must be met by accountability and a personal desire to learn and grow by those served. <strong> Casa de Maná </strong>  offers opportunities for the community to support, influence and participate.</p>

           <p>This approach creates an environment where the less fortunate can restore their self-esteem, retain their human dignity, and regain the power and abilities necessary to become self-sufficient and productive members of our community.</p>
